# Introduction To Quantitative Methods 

This repository holds the scripts for a semester-long course that introduces students to quantitative methods for political science. This course is for students with minimal experience with statistics and who have yet to gain experience with coding. The course is written in `R` and uses RMarkdown notebooks to take students from basic tasks like importing and summarizing data through multiple regression with interaction effects. Many scripts utilize simulations to teach intuition behind statistical concepts while demonstrating what is possible with computational methods. Throughout the course, students will learn to visualize data and results with `ggplot2`.Â 

## Structure 

The scripts are in the order they are taught and run from basics of importing an summarizing all the way through interaction effects. Titles are written to give a sense of what each script contains. 

`data` - this folder holds all the data utilized in the scripts themselves. The datasets relate to common political science and public policy questions.
